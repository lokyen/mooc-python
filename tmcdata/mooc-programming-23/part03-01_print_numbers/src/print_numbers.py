# Write your solution here

# Please write a program which prints out all the even numbers between two and thirty, using a loop. Print each number on a separate line.

# The beginning of your output should look like this:

# Sample output

# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
# etc...

num = 2

while num <= 30:
    print(num)
    num += 2
